# 42-c2-pipex
Program about pipes and child processes

## **How to run**

Compile the code running the `make` command.

Type `./pipex` in the terminal while you are in the same directory as the executable followed by the syntax `infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile`.

## **Important Notes**
- This project requires LIBFT to compile. Alternatively, custom functions can be replaced with built-in or standard C functions.
- If LIBFT is saved anywhere but its subfolder under the cwd (current working directory), the header file and the Makefile must be updated with the correct paths.
- The current version is only designed to handle 2 commands. This implementation has been fixed in the minishell code for more flexibility.
